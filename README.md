#Objective

This is a simple tool created above monkeyrunner to facilitate the work on mobile automation and testing.
For now it only support click event with delay and that helped me a lot on creating Monkeyrunner bots that use screen coordinate.

#Environement

for this to work you need to add the Monkeyrunner location to your path variable


#Start

To start you have to plug your phone and start the app, this will take a screenshot for the device.
if you click on a place on the photo, this will display it's coordinate, then you can click execute to execute the click event on the device or next to add it to a variable that you can use next.
the refresh button take a new screenshot of the device.

#Issues

Sometime device detection is not working well you have juste to unplug then replug your device
